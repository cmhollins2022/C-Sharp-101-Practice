### Hello World
What is a __console__? Whatever is in the quotations will return to the console.
Strings must be explicitly declared.

```string aFriend = "Tyler";```
```Console.WriteLine($"Hello  + {aFriend}");```

### The Basics of Strings
What is a __string__? A series of characters that can be declared. Stored within an array.
The ```Length``` property shows how long the string is.

The ```Trim```, ```TrimStart``` and ```TrimEnd``` methods remove leading and trailing spaces. (Better Formatting)

The ```Replace``` method searches for a substring (or first parameter) and replaces is it with a second parameter.
